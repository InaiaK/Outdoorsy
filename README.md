## EventListner 

  EventListener is a web-based application that allows the user to enter a location in the search bar along with a date in the datepicker below to request a list of events nearby to the stated location. Below is an example of a location search result. On the left is the sidebar that contains the search input, a datepicker, and weather data for the selected event result (if no result is selected, most recently selected event data will be loaded from local storage). In the main section, event results are loaded with a map, description of the event, and a link to the event page.



## User Story 

AS a user I would like to find an event nearby a given location at a given date.

WHEN entering a location I want to have list of events nearby with information about each one.

WHEN I select an event, I am presented the weather and a forecast along with a map of the venue and event details.
